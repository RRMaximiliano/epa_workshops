    "text": "Welcome to the Final Project\nWelcome to the EPA101 Policy Analysis Final Group Project! This project is an opportunity for you to apply the policy analysis skills you have developed throughout the course. You will work in groups to analyze a policy problem, consider alternative solutions, evaluate them against specific criteria, and make a recommendation to a client.\nBelow is a table outlining the components of the Final Group Project and what you need to do for each part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nDescription\n\n\n\n\na) Problem Statement\ni) A clear, concise problem statementii) Discussion of evidence and reasoning supporting the problem statement you have chosen- Formulate a clear and concise statement of the policy problem you are addressing.- Provide evidence and reasoning supporting it.\n\n\nb) Alternatives\n- Identify 3-4 distinct policy alternatives, each of which plausibly addresses the stated problem.- Develop 3-4 viable policy alternatives that could potentially solve the problem you’ve identified.\n\n\nc) Criteria\ni) At least 3 distinct criteria to compare the policy alternativesii) Discussion of how to measure or evaluate each criterioniii) How the criteria relate to broader objectives and values- Establish evaluation criteria and explain their relevance.\n\n\nd) Project the Outcomes\ni) Describe projected outcomes for each alternative on each criterionii) An analysis matrix (alternatives vs. criteria)iii) Explain how you arrived at each projectioniv) Discuss key stakeholders and their potential responses\n\n\ne) Confront the Tradeoffs\ni) Describe tradeoffs between alternatives given your criteria and projected outcomesii) Explain the reasoning used to resolve those tradeoffs to reach your recommendation\n\n\nf) Uncertainty\ni) Describe important sources of uncertainty and assumptions madeii) Discuss how changes in assumptions could affect your recommended alternative\n\n\ng) Recommendation\n- Recommend one of the alternatives evaluated and clearly state that recommendation in the memo’s first paragraph.- Make a clear and concise recommendation based on your analysis.\n\n\nh) Client\n- Identify a client: an organization, agency, or public official with an interest in the policy problem.Note: It is not necessary to communicate or interact with the client for EPA101."
