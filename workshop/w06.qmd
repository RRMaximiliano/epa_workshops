## Workshop Overview

In this final workshop, we focus on crafting Individual Memos, an essential skill for effective policy analysis. The memo provides actionable recommendations, supported by analysis and evidence, in a concise and clear format tailored to the needs of your client.

## Objectives

- Analyze and critique sample memos to identify strengths and areas for improvement.
- Develop concise writing strategies to create impactful, focused memos.
- Learn tools for structuring arguments, addressing counterarguments, and aligning recommendations with client priorities.

## Activities

- Memo Analysis: Review and critique sample memos to understand best practices.
- Interactive Exercise: Roleplay as an analyst, summarizing findings and making recommendations.
- Grandma Bessie Test: Craft and refine a 1-minute elevator pitch for your memo.

## Key Takeaways

- Clarity is crucial: Place the recommendation upfront, use simple language, and structure the memo for readability.
- Brevity matters: Stay within the word count by prioritizing essential ideas.
- Anticipate client needs: Align every argument with what matters most to the client.
- Use visual aids: Simplify complex arguments and comparisons with tables, graphs, or matrices.
- Practice storytelling: Frame the memo as a narrativeâ€”problem, options, recommendation, and evidence.
