This project is an opportunity for you to apply the policy analysis skills you have developed throughout the course. You will work in groups to analyze a policy problem, consider alternative solutions, evaluate them against specific criteria, and make a recommendation to a client.\n\nBelow is a table outlining the components of the Final Group Project and what you need to do for each part.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Component </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Description </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 30%; \"> <strong>a) Problem Statement</strong> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 70%; \"> i) A clear, concise problem statement<br><br>ii) Discussion of evidence and reasoning supporting the problem statement you have chosen<br><br>- Formulate a clear and concise statement of the policy problem you are addressing.<br>- Provide evidence and reasoning supporting it. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 30%; \"> <strong>b) Alternatives</strong> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 70%; \"> - Identify 3-4 distinct policy alternatives, each of which plausibly addresses the stated problem.<br><br>- Develop 3-4 viable policy alternatives that could potentially solve the problem you've identified. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 30%; \"> <strong>c) Criteria</strong> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 70%; \"> i) At least 3 distinct criteria to compare the policy alternatives<br><br>ii) Discussion of how to measure or evaluate each criterion<br><br>iii) How the criteria relate to broader objectives and values<br><br>- Establish evaluation criteria and explain their relevance. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 30%; \"> <strong>d) Project the Outcomes</strong> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 70%; \"> i) Describe projected outcomes for each alternative on each criterion<br><br>ii) An analysis matrix (alternatives vs. criteria)<br><br>iii) Explain how you arrived at each projection<br><br>iv) Discuss key stakeholders and their potential responses </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 30%; \"> <strong>e) Confront the Tradeoffs</strong> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 70%; \"> i) Describe tradeoffs between alternatives given your criteria and projected outcomes<br><br>ii) Explain the reasoning used to resolve those tradeoffs to reach your recommendation </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 30%; \"> <strong>f) Uncertainty</strong> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 70%; \"> i) Describe important sources of uncertainty and assumptions made<br><br>ii) Discuss how changes in assumptions could affect your recommended alternative </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 30%; \"> <strong>g) Recommendation</strong> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 70%; \"> - Recommend one of the alternatives evaluated and clearly state that recommendation in the memoâ€™s first paragraph.<br><br>- Make a clear and concise recommendation based on your analysis. </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 30%; \"> <strong>h) Client</strong> </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 70%; \"> - Identify a client: an organization, agency, or public official with an interest in the policy problem.<br><br>*Note: It is not necessary to communicate or interact with the client for EPA101.* </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n",
