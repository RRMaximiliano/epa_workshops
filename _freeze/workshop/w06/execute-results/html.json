The memo provides actionable recommendations, supported by analysis and evidence, in a concise and clear format tailored to the needs of your client.\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Analyze and critique sample memos to identify strengths and areas for improvement.\n- Develop concise writing strategies to create impactful, focused memos.\n- Learn tools for structuring arguments, addressing counterarguments, and aligning recommendations with client priorities.\n\n## Activities\n\n- Memo Analysis: Review and critique sample memos to understand best practices.\n- Interactive Exercise: Roleplay as an analyst, summarizing findings and making recommendations.\n- Grandma Bessie Test: Craft and refine a 1-minute elevator pitch for your memo.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- Clarity is crucial: Place the recommendation upfront, use simple language, and structure the memo for readability.\n- Brevity matters: Stay within the word count by prioritizing essential ideas.\n- Anticipate client needs: Align every argument with what matters most to the client.\n- Use visual aids: Simplify complex arguments and comparisons with tables, graphs, or matrices.\n- Practice storytelling: Frame the memo as a narrativeâ€”problem, options, recommendation, and evidence.\n\nPrepare to leave this workshop equipped with tools to create effective, polished policy memos that make a lasting impact!\n\n",
