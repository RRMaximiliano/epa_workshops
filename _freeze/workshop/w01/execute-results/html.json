In this session, we will focus on defining your policy problem within the field of **education policy** and assembling the necessary evidence to support your analysis.\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"text-center buttons\"><a class=\"btn btn-danger\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"../slides/workshop01.html\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-arrow-up-right-from-square\"></i> View all slides in new window</a> <a class=\"btn btn-danger\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"../slides/workshop01.pdf\" role=\"button\"><i class=\"fa-solid fa-file-pdf\"></i> Download PDF of all slides</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"position: relative;overflow: hidden;width: 100%;min-height:600px;\">\n<iframe src=\"../slides/workshop01.html\" style=\"position=absolute;top: 0;left: 0;bottom: 0;right: 0;width: 100%;min-height:600px;\"></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Conduct a **situational analysis** in education policy.\n- Frame a clear and concise **policy question**.\n- Effectively **define the problem** you aim to address.\n- Begin assembling **evidence** to support your problem statement.\n\n## Situational Analysis\n\nA situational analysis helps you understand the context and environment in which your policy problem exists. In education policy, this involves examining various factors that influence educational outcomes.\n\n### Steps for Situational Analysis\n\n1. **Identify the Context**\n\n   - Determine the specific area of education you are focusing on (e.g., K-12, higher education, special education).\n   - Understand the geographical scope (local, state, national).\n\n2. **Gather Data**\n\n   - Collect quantitative data: graduation rates, test scores, funding levels.\n   - Collect qualitative data: stakeholder interviews, case studies.\n\n3. **Analyze Policy Environment**\n\n   - Review existing policies, regulations, and legislation.\n   - Identify recent reforms or initiatives.\n\n4. **Stakeholder Analysis**\n\n   - Identify key stakeholders: students, parents, teachers, administrators, policymakers.\n   - Understand their interests, influence, and relationships.\n\n5. **Identify Challenges and Opportunities**\n\n   - Highlight gaps in policy implementation.\n   - Note any emerging trends or issues.\n\n## Framing Your Policy Question\n\nA well-framed policy question guides your analysis and sets the direction for your research.\n\n### Characteristics of a Good Policy Question\n\n- **Specific**: Clearly defines the issue without being too narrow.\n- **Researchable**: Can be answered through analysis and evidence.\n- **Relevant**: Addresses a significant problem affecting stakeholders.\n- **Neutral**: Avoids bias and does not assume a solution.\n\n### Example Policy Questions\n\n- *\"How can state education agencies improve access to quality STEM education in underfunded schools?\"*\n- *\"What policies can reduce the achievement gap between urban and rural students in standardized testing?\"*\n- *\"In what ways can teacher retention rates be increased in low-income districts?\"*\n\n## Defining the Problem\n\nDefining the problem is a critical step that sets the foundation for your policy analysis.\n\n### Guidelines for Problem Definition\n\n1. **Be Clear and Concise**\n\n   - Articulate the problem in a straightforward manner.\n   - Keep the statement focused on a single issue.\n\n2. **Use Evidence**\n\n   - Support your problem definition with data and research.\n   - Cite credible sources to substantiate the problem's significance.\n\n3. **Focus on the Root Cause**\n\n   - Distinguish between symptoms and underlying causes.\n   - Aim to address the root of the problem, not just its manifestations.\n\n4. **Consider the Impact**\n\n   - Explain who is affected and how.\n   - Discuss the short-term and long-term consequences.\n\n### Problem Definition Template\n\n- **Problem Statement**: *[Subject] is experiencing [problem], resulting in [consequences], due to [root cause].*\n\n### Example Problem Definition\n\n- *\"Low-income high school students in urban areas are experiencing high dropout rates, resulting in reduced employment opportunities and perpetuating cycles of poverty, due to insufficient access to supportive educational resources and interventions.\"*\n\n\n## Assembling Evidence\n\nCollecting robust evidence is essential to support your problem statement and future policy recommendations.\n\n### Types of Evidence to Collect\n\n- **Statistical Data**\n\n  - Enrollment and dropout rates.\n  - Test scores and academic performance metrics.\n\n- **Research Studies**\n\n  - Academic articles analyzing similar problems.\n  - Meta-analyses and literature reviews.\n\n- **Policy Documents**\n\n  - Existing laws, regulations, and policy briefs.\n  - Government reports and white papers.\n\n- **Stakeholder Perspectives**\n\n  - Interviews or surveys with affected populations.\n  - Testimonies from educators and administrators.\n\n### Reliable Sources\n\n- **Government Agencies**\n\n  - U.S. Department of Education\n  - National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)\n\n- **International Organizations**\n\n  - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\n  - United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)\n\n- **Academic Journals**\n\n  - *Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis*\n  - *Journal of Education Policy*\n\n- **Think Tanks and Research Institutes**\n\n  - Brookings Institution\n  - RAND Corporation\n  - Education Policy Institute\n\n### Organizing Your Evidence\n\n- **Create an Evidence Matrix**\n\n  - Organize evidence by source, type, and relevance.\n  - Note the key findings and how they support your problem statement.\n\n- **Evaluate Source Credibility**\n\n  - Assess the reliability and validity of your sources.\n  - Prioritize peer-reviewed and official publications.\n\n## Action Items\n\nBy the end of this workshop, you should:\n\n- **Draft a Clear Problem Statement**\n\n  - Use the guidelines provided to write your initial problem statement.\n\n- **Begin Your Situational Analysis**\n\n  - Collect preliminary data and identify key stakeholders.\n\n- **Compile Initial Evidence**\n\n  - Gather at least 3-5 credible sources that support your problem definition.\n\n## Upcoming Deliverable\n\n- **Draft #1 Due on Sept. 18**\n\n  - **Assignment**: Sector Analysis & Problem Definition\n  - **Requirements**:\n\n    - A concise problem statement.\n    - A situational analysis summarizing the context.\n    - A preliminary list of evidence.\n\n## Tips for Success\n\n- **Start Early**\n\n  - Give yourself ample time to research and refine your problem statement.\n\n- **Seek Feedback**\n\n  - Discuss your ideas with peers or instructors to gain new perspectives.\n\n- **Be Open to Revisions**\n\n  - Your problem definition may evolve as you gather more evidence.\n\n- **Maintain Academic Integrity**\n\n  - Cite all sources appropriately to avoid plagiarism.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- **Policy Analysis Guides**\n\n  -
