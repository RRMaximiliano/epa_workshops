# Step 2: Assemble Some Evidence

## Importance of Evidence

- **Core Activities in Policy Analysis:**
  - **Thinking:** Conceptualizing and strategizing.
  - **Hustling Data:** Gathering meaningful information.

- **Time Constraints:** Real-world policy analysis often faces tight deadlines.

> *"Evidence is information that affects the existing beliefs of important people... about significant features of the problem."*  
> — Bardach & Patashnik, 2020, p. 36

## Purposes of Assembling Evidence

1. **Assess the Problem:**
   - Understand the nature and extent of the education issue.

2. **Understand the Policy Context:**
   - Insights into factors like funding, teacher qualifications, demographic changes.

3. **Evaluate Existing Policies:**
   - Examine what has worked in other education systems or regions.

## Example: Improving Student Performance

- **Problem:** Declining standardized test scores in public schools.
- **Evidence Needed:**
  - Current performance metrics.
  - Teacher-student ratios.
  - Funding levels.
  - Socioeconomic factors affecting students.

# Efficient Data Collection

## Strategies

- **Focus on Relevance:** Continuously evaluate the necessity of the data.
- **Avoid Irrelevant Data:** Prevent collecting information that doesn't inform policy decisions.
- **Value vs. Cost:** Balance the effort and resources against the potential impact of the evidence.

## Tips for Data Collection

- **Start Early:** Initiate data collection promptly to accommodate stakeholders' schedules.
- **Review Available Literature:** Utilize online databases and academic journals.
- **Use Analogies and Best Practices:** Learn from successful education policies in other regions.

## Group Exercise 1: 10 minutes

**Topic:** Assembling Evidence for Education Policy

**Task:**

- **Scenario:** Addressing X or Y problem (in your groups).
- **In Groups:**
  1. Identify key pieces of evidence needed (rank the evidence).
  2. Discuss sources for this evidence.
  3. Outline strategies to collect this data efficiently.

**Share Your Findings:** Assign a group speaker. Each group will present a 1 min summary.

# Step 3: Construct the Alternatives

## Defining Alternatives

- **Alternatives:** Different policy options or strategies to solve the education issue.

> *"Policy alternatives can range from single actions to combinations of strategies."*  
> — Bardach & Patashnik, 2020, p. 42

---

## Comprehensive vs. Focused Alternatives

- **Start Comprehensive:**
  - Generate a wide range of potential solutions.
- **Narrow Down:**
  - Eliminate less viable options to focus on the most promising ones.

## Example: Reducing Achievement Gaps

**Possible Alternatives:**

1. **Increase Funding for Underperforming Schools:**
   - Allocate more resources to schools with low performance metrics.

2. **Implement Targeted Teacher Training Programs:**
   - Enhance teacher skills in diverse and underserved classrooms.

3. **Introduce After-School Tutoring Programs:**
   - Provide additional academic support for struggling students.

## Sources for Generating Alternatives

1. **Proposals from Political Actors:**
   - Review existing policy suggestions from education boards and policymakers.

2. **Generic Strategies:**
   - Refer to "Things Governments Do" checklist for innovative ideas.

3. **Unconventional Solutions:**
   - Encourage out-of-the-box thinking, such as technology integration or community partnerships.

## Creative Techniques

- **"If Cost Were No Object":**
  - Imagine ideal solutions without budget constraints.

- **Analogous Contexts:**
  - Apply successful strategies from other sectors or countries.

- **Challenge Assumptions:**
  - Regularly ask “why not” to explore new possibilities.

## Group Exercise 2: 15 minutes

**Topic:** Constructing Alternatives for Education Policy

**Task:**

- **Scenario:** Groups of 5s, split into 2, and then merge with the other group. Groups of 3s will be merged and create one group. Total 3 groups.
- **In Groups:**
  1. Brainstorm at least two alternative policies (2-5 minutes).
  2. Ensure each alternative is distinct and actionable.
  3. Present your alternatives briefly and discuss feasibility (5 minutes).

**Share Your Findings:** In your new groups, assign a group speaker. Share with the session how you weight the alternatives and whether you think you currently have enough evidence for it.   

# Step 4: Select the Criteria

## Understanding Criteria

- **Criteria:** Standards used to evaluate the potential outcomes of each alternative.
- **Purpose:** Bridge analytic facts and evaluative judgments.

> *"Criteria are evaluative standards used to judge the goodness of the projected policy outcomes."*  
> — Bardach & Patashnik, 2020, p. 53


## Types of Criteria

1. **Evaluative Criteria:**
   - Standards to assess desirability (e.g., efficiency, equity).

2. **Practical Criteria:**
   - Considerations related to implementation (e.g., legality, political acceptability).

## Common Evaluative Criteria

- **Efficiency:** Maximizing resources to achieve goals.
- **Effectiveness:** Degree to which objectives are met.
- **Equity:** Fairness in distribution of benefits and burdens.
- **Political Acceptability:** Support from stakeholders and policymakers.


## Example: Criteria for Reducing Achievement Gaps

1. **Primary Criterion:**
   - **Effectiveness:** Significant reduction in achievement gaps.

2. **Secondary Criteria:**
   - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Optimal use of budget resources.
   - **Equity:** Fair distribution of resources among all student demographics.
   - **Political Feasibility:** Support from key stakeholders.


# Selecting and Defining Criteria

## Steps to Define Criteria

1. **Primary Criterion:** Directly addresses the core problem.
2. **Secondary Criteria:** Additional factors influencing desirability.

### Define Metrics

| **Criterion**   | **Metric**                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Efficiency      | Cost per student improvement               |
| Effectiveness   | Percentage decrease in achievement gaps    |
| Equity          | Distribution of resources across demographics |
| Political Acceptability | Level of stakeholder support            |

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

- **Do Not Confuse Alternatives with Criteria:**
  - Alternatives are actions; criteria are standards for evaluation.

> *"Alternatives are courses of action, whereas criteria are mental standards for evaluating the results of action."*  
> — Bardach & Patashnik, 2020, p. 69


## Weighting Criteria

- **Relative Importance:** Assign weights based on policy goals.
- **Balancing Values:** Prioritize criteria based on overarching values.

### Approaches to Weighting

1. **Political Process:**
   - Let existing frameworks determine weights.

2. **Analyst Imposition:**
   - Adjust weights to reflect fairness and underrepresented interests.

## Practical Application

- **Group Separately:**
  - Positive (benefit) criteria vs. Negative (cost) criteria.
- **Specify Metrics:**
  - Ensure clarity and measurability.
- **Focus on Relevance:**
  - Criteria should align with policy objectives.

## Group Exercise 3: 15 minutes

**Topic:** Selecting Evaluation Criteria

**Task:**
- **Scenario:** Evaluating alternatives to improve digital literacy in schools.
- **In Groups:**
  1. Identify and list potential criteria.
  2. Define clear metrics for each criterion.
  3. Assign relative weights to each criterion.

**Share Your Findings:** Each group presents their criteria and metrics.


## Conclusion

- **Assembling Evidence:** 
  - Critical for understanding and framing the problem.
- **Constructing Alternatives:** 
  - Generates viable policy options.
- **Selecting Criteria:** 
  - Ensures objective and value-driven evaluations.
