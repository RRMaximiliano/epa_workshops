## Introduction

**Welcome to the Policy Analysis Workshop!**

Today, we will focus on **Step 4** from Bardach and Patashnik’s _A Practical Guide for Policy Analysis_ (2020):

4. **Select the Criteria**

## Agenda

**Step 4: Select the Criteria** 

- Understanding Criteria
- Types of Criteria
- Selecting and Defining Criteria
- Weighting Criteria

# Step 4: Select the Criteria

## Understanding Criteria

- **Criteria:** Standards used to evaluate the potential outcomes of each alternative.
- **Purpose:** Bridge analytic facts and evaluative judgments.

> *"Criteria are evaluative standards used to judge the goodness of the projected policy outcomes."*  
> — Bardach & Patashnik, 2020, p. 53


## Types of Criteria

1. **Evaluative Criteria:**
   - Standards to assess desirability (e.g., efficiency, equity).

2. **Practical Criteria:**
   - Considerations related to implementation (e.g., legality, political acceptability).

## Common Evaluative Criteria

- **Efficiency:** Maximizing resources to achieve goals.
- **Effectiveness:** Degree to which objectives are met.
- **Equity:** Fairness in distribution of benefits and burdens.
- **Political Acceptability:** Support from stakeholders and policymakers.


## Example: Criteria for Reducing Achievement Gaps

1. **Primary Criterion:**
   - **Effectiveness:** Significant reduction in achievement gaps.

2. **Secondary Criteria:**
   - **Cost-Effectiveness:** Optimal use of budget resources.
   - **Equity:** Fair distribution of resources among all student demographics.
   - **Political Feasibility:** Support from key stakeholders.


# Selecting and Defining Criteria

## Steps to Define Criteria

1. **Primary Criterion:** Directly addresses the core problem.
2. **Secondary Criteria:** Additional factors influencing desirability.

### Define Metrics

| **Criterion**   | **Metric**                                 |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Efficiency      | Cost per student improvement               |
| Effectiveness   | Percentage decrease in achievement gaps    |
| Equity          | Distribution of resources across demographics |
| Political Acceptability | Level of stakeholder support            |

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

- **Do Not Confuse Alternatives with Criteria:**
  - Alternatives are actions; criteria are standards for evaluation.

> *"Alternatives are courses of action, whereas criteria are mental standards for evaluating the results of action."*  
> — Bardach & Patashnik, 2020, p. 69


## Weighting Criteria

- **Relative Importance:** Assign weights based on policy goals.
- **Balancing Values:** Prioritize criteria based on overarching values.

### Approaches to Weighting

1. **Political Process:**
   - Let existing frameworks determine weights.

2. **Analyst Imposition:**
   - Adjust weights to reflect fairness and underrepresented interests.

## Practical Application

- **Group Separately:**
  - Positive (benefit) criteria vs. Negative (cost) criteria.
- **Specify Metrics:**
  - Ensure clarity and measurability.
- **Focus on Relevance:**
  - Criteria should align with policy objectives.

## Group Exercise:

**Topic:** Selecting Evaluation Criteria

**Task:**

- **Scenario:** Evaluating alternatives to improve digital literacy in schools.
- **In Groups:**

  1. Identify and list potential criteria.
  2. Define clear metrics for each criterion.
  3. Assign relative weights to each criterion.

**Share Your Findings:** Each group presents their criteria and metrics.


## Conclusion

- **Assembling Evidence:** 
  - Critical for understanding and framing the problem.
- **Constructing Alternatives:** 
  - Generates viable policy options.
- **Selecting Criteria:** 
  - Ensures objective and value-driven evaluations.
