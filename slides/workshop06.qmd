- Imagine you are the client listed as the recipient.
- **Questions**:
  - What do you like about this memo?
  - What makes the recommendation clear and convincing?
  - How does it balance brevity with depth?
:::

## Memo as a Story: Problem-Solving Framework (10 minutes)

From the examples you just read:

- **Problem**: What issue needs solving?
- **Options**: What alternatives are available?
- **Recommendation**: What is the best course of action?
- **Evidence**: Why is this recommendation effective?

Discuss the consequences of:

1. **Action**: What will improve or change if the recommendation is adopted?
2. **Inaction**: What happens if the client does nothing?

## Writing Strategies: **Eric Taylor’s Guide**

- **Know Your Audience**:
  - Understand their needs, prior beliefs, and decision-making scope. Tailor your recommendations to align with their priorities.

- **Write Simply**:
  - Use clear, concise language; avoid jargon unless necessary. Active voice and first-person perspective make writing more direct.

- **Organize Strategically**:
  - Place the **bottom line at the top**—state your recommendation and main argument upfront. Integrate relevant background information into the narrative.
  - Use meaningful section titles to convey your argument clearly.

- **Practice Brevity**:
  - Include only the most essential ideas and arguments.

## Writing Strategies: **Eric Taylor’s Guide**

- **Use Visual Aids Effectively**:
  - Include **graphs, diagrams, and tables** to simplify complex data.

- **Reason, Then Communicate**:
  - Every claim must have supporting evidence and reasoning. Anticipate and address the **best counterarguments** to your recommendation.

- **Check for Robustness**:
  - Explicitly state assumptions and test whether changes to those assumptions affect your recommendation.

- **Final Tip**:
  - Tie every point back to what your client cares about most—whether it's cost-efficiency, political feasibility, or another priority.

  - Pair up and exchange feedback.
- **Tips**:
  - Start with the recommendation.
  - Explain the problem and why your solution is best.
  - Tie back to client priorities (e.g., cost, political feasibility).
