## Importance of Policy Analysis

> "Policy analysis is a social and political activity [...] it concerns the lives and well-being of large numbers of their fellow citizens."  
> — *Bardach and Patashnik (2020)*

- Goes beyond personal decision-making
- Involves collaboration with professionals and stakeholders
- Affects public welfare and resource allocation


## Bardach's Eightfold Path

1. **Define the Problem**
2. Assemble Some Evidence
3. Construct the Alternatives
4. Select the Criteria
5. Project the Outcomes
6. Confront the Trade-offs
7. Stop, focus, narrow, deepen and decide
8. Tell Your Story

## Today
Focus on **Step One: Define the Problem**
:::

## Defining the Problem

- **Identify actors**

- **Think in Terms of Deficit and Excess**
  - Use words like *too much*, *too little*, *too fast*, *too slow*
- **Make the Definition Evaluative**
  - Identify why the situation is problematic
  - Consider different perspectives and evaluative frameworks
- **Quantify If Possible**
  - Attach magnitudes to deficits or excesses
  - Use data to support your problem statement
  - Avoid defining the solution into the problem!

## Which of the following is the strongest problem statement?  

1. There are not enough qualified teachers entering the workforce, so policymakers should consider raising salaries, improving working conditions, and reducing classroom size.
1. Many teachers enter the workforce without the proper qualifications, so policymakers need to increase teacher salaries to attract more qualified candidates. 
1. There are too few qualified teachers entering the workforce, resulting in overcrowded classrooms with unqualified teachers.  
1. There are too few qualified teachers entering the workforce due to lack of adequate pay and poor working conditions.

## Situation Analysis in Policy Work

- **Assess the Particular Features of the Situation**
  - Understand the context and environment of the policy issue
  - Identify stakeholders, resources, constraints, and opportunities
- **Importance in Education Policy**
  - Education policies are influenced by social, economic, and political factors
  - Requires understanding of institutional structures and target populations

## Not-real Example: Situation Analysis in Education Policy

- **Case Study:** High Teacher Turnover in Urban Schools in Country X.
  - **Problem Definition:** "There is an excessive rate of teacher turnover in urban public schools, leading to decreased educational quality and student performance."
- **Situation Analysis:**
  - **Context:** Urban schools experiencing annual teacher turnover rates exceeding 25%
  - **Stakeholders:** Teachers, students, parents, school administrators, education departments
  - **Constraints:** Low teacher salaries, challenging work environments, lack of resources
  - **Opportunities:** Implement teacher retention programs, offer incentives, improve working conditions

## Tips for Creating Good Problem Statements

- **Data – How Specific?**
  - Be precise with data usage

- **Deficit and Excess**
  - Use phrases like "too many students..."

- **Odds**
  - Express likelihoods, e.g., "highly likely that..."

- **Quantify**
  - Include statistics like "3 out of 10..."

## Tips for Creating Good Problem Statements

- **Why This Problem? Why Now?**
  - Justify the urgency and relevance

- **Latent Opportunities**
  - Identify what could improve

- **Trends & Location**
  - Explain urgency through trends and specific locations

- **Iterate & Consider Naysayers**
  - Be open to feedback and different perspectives

## Group Exercise 1: Refining Problem Statements

- **Activity (20 minutes):**
  - **Form new groups** by mixing members from different project teams
  - **Exchange problem statements** from your projects
  - **Review and provide feedback** using Bardach's guidelines:
  1. Is the problem framed in terms of deficit or excess?
  2. Does it include an evaluative component?
  3. Have common pitfalls been avoided?
- **Discussion Points:**
  - How can the problem statement be improved?
  - Are there quantifiable elements that can be added?
  - What alternative perspectives should be considered?

## Example: Situation Analysis in Education Policy

::: {.incremental}
- **Case Study:** Florida's Immigration Bill Impact on Undocumented Students
  - **Problem Definition:** "There is a significant deficit in equitable access to Florida's public higher education for undocumented students caused by recent restrictive immigration legislation."
- **Situation Analysis:**
  - **Context:** New legislation prohibiting funds for identification documents to undocumented immigrants
  - **Stakeholders:** Undocumented students, universities, state government, community organizations
  - **Constraints:** Legal barriers, fear of data collection, reduced financial aid options
  - **Opportunities:** Advocacy for policy change, community support programs

:::

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Defining the Solution into the Problem**
  - Avoid implying a specific solution in your problem statement
  - Example: Don't say "There is too little shelter for homeless families"
  - Instead, say "Too many families are homeless"
  - Too little was use here in this example, why is it different from "think in terms of definit anc excess" from the last slide?
- **Assuming Causality Without Evidence**
  - Don't assume causes without proper analysis
  - Base your problem definition on evidence, not assumptions


## Group Exercise 2: Applying Situation Analysis

- **Activity (20 minutes):**
  - Return to your original project groups
  - **Perform a situation analysis** for your policy issue:
  1. Identify key stakeholders
  2. Outline the context and environment
  3. Note constraints and opportunities
  - **Prepare to share** a brief summary with the larger group and changes you made

## Assembling Evidence

> "Think before you collect [...] you can be a much more efficient collector of data if you think about what you need."  
> — *Bardach and Patashnik (2020)*

- **Purpose of Evidence Gathering:**
  - Assess the nature and extent of the problem
  - Understand the policy situation and context
- **In Education Policy:**
  - Use data on enrollment, demographics, funding, outcomes
  - Consider qualitative information from stakeholders

## Group Exercise 3: Planning Evidence Collection

- **Activity (15 minutes):**
  - In your project groups, **outline a plan** for assembling evidence:
  1. What data do you need to quantify your problem?
  2. Where can you find this information?
  3. How will you ensure the evidence is relevant and reliable?
  - **Share one key data source** you plan to use
  
# Your Projects

## Project 1: Impact of Florida's Immigration Bill on Undocumented Students
